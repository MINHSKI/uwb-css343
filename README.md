CSS343 Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains source code for the course, demonstrating
a variety of basic data structures and algorithms, including code to
generate animation sequences.

wordcount/ contains a variety of implementations of a program to count
the number of words in a file.  Generally, the input is assumed to
have a single word per line.  Implementations include:
o 2-3 tree (C++ & Python)
o B tree (C++)
o C++ std::map
o Python dict
o red-black tree (Python)
o shell pipeline

heap/ contains script to generate an animation of construction and
destruction of a binary heap (priority queue).

Note that this code is *not* intended to be considered
production-grade; it is posted to demonstrate basic computer science
algorithms and to demonstrate programming techniques.

The single most _unprofessional_ thing you can say about your
programming is, "I bet you can't guess what this does".  Nevertheless,
mastering list comprehensions and iterators will allow you to express
in a single line something that might be two for loops and an if
statement, with no loss in code clarity, a gain in your productivity,
and possibly a performance boost.
