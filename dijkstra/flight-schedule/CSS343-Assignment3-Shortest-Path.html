  <h1>Assignment 3: Shortest Path</h1>


  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    We wish to travel from some departure airport to a destination
    airport such that we will arrive at the destination the at the
    earliest possible time.  The direct path (if there is one) might
    not give the earliest arrival time, so the solution will probably
    be a multi-legged itinerary.  There is a minimum layover time at
    every intermediate airport which must be factored into the
    scheduling.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also wish to know, for our chosen itinerary, the total time
    enroute (difference between departure time of the first flight and
    arrival time of the last flight), the total in-flight time, and
    the total layover time.  The enroute time should equal inflight
    time plus layover time.
  </p>


  <h2>The solution</h2>

  <p>
    Write a program called
    <code>find_itinerary</code>.
    Flight data will be read from standard input and the origin and
    destination airports shall be command-line arguments
    <code>argv[1]</code> (origin)
    and
    <code>argv[2]</code> (destination).
  </p>

  <p>
    Write a separate stand-alone program
    <code>flight_summary</code>
    that takes the output of
    <code>find_itinerary</code>
    and produces the summary statistics enroute time, in-flight time,
    and layover time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Solve the problem using Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm.
    Represent the network of flights as a directed graph.  Use an
    edge list, not an adjacency matrix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Assume the minimum layover is 1 hour.  Define this as a
    class (static) variable so that an API might be added in some
    future release to allow runtime control of this parameter.
  </p>


  <h3>Input Format</h3>

  <p>
    Each node is represented by an airport identifier (three- or
    four-letter airport code).  Assume that some other part of the
    hypothetical system keeps data associating the identifier with the
    city and airport name to provide for readable output.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time values are a (decimal) numeric value dddhhmm where ddd is the
    day of the year (1-365), hh is the hour (24-hour clock, midnight
    is 00) and mm is the minute (0-59).  As a simplifying assumption,
    we won't deal with the year-end wrap-around.  Do not hesitate to
    convert this value to some more-convenient internal format.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each edge contains a set of flights, each with its departure and
    arrival time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The input file consistes of one-line records, each record
    containing for tab-separated fields:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      origin airport
    </li>
    <li>
      departure time
    </li>
    <li>
      destination airport
    </li>
    <li>
      arrival time
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    There is no need to represent the airports (nodes) in the input
    file: it can be generated from the edge list.
  </p>


  <h3>Output Format</h3>

  <p>
    The output will be a list of flights in the same format as the
    input.
  </p>

  <h2>What to Hand In</h2>

  <p class="with_list">
    The usual:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      source code
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Run</code>
      script
    </li>
    <li>
      test data
    </li>
    <li>
      optional
      <code>README</code>
      file.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Additional Notes</h2>


  <h3>Intermediate Milestones</h3>

  <p>
    Determine them yourself.  Think about reasonable subproblems that
    you could build and test separately.
  </p>


  <h3>Standard Library</h3>

  <p>
    Use
    <code>std::map</code>
    <em>only</em>
    for building the graph from the file.
    Use
    <code>std::vector</code>
    to hold the edge list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the STL
    <code>priority_queue</code>
    class is missing the
    <code>decrease_key</code>
    operation required by Dijkstra's algorithm, so you couldn't use it
    even if it were permitted.
  </p>


  <h3>Time Differences</h3>

  <p>
    Flight data has absolute start and end times which we will wish
    to compare.  We will also wish to compute time differences
    (relative time or interval).  Thes are two logical candidates for
    distinct classes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The constructor for the absolute time class should take a
    <code>dddhhmm</code>
    value as argument.  You probably want to implement comparison
    operators.
  </p>

  <p>
    The constructor for the relative time class
    should take two absolute time objects and compute their
    difference.  You probably want to implement a sum method.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may or may not want to implement other constructors and/or
    methods.
  </p>


  <h3>Reuse</h3>

  <p>
    Since the output format of
    <code>find_itinerary</code>
    conventiently matches its input format, you should be able to
    reuse your input and time routines in
    <code>flight_summary</code>.
  </p>


  <h3> Test Data</h3>

  <p>
    Here are some Washington State airports with selected distances
    between them (in nautical miles).  You may use this graph to
    produce your flight data, or generate data on your own.

  <h2>Bonus Marks</h2>

  <p>
    People select flights not only by arrival time.  Modify your
    program so it takes an additional command-line argument which may
    be one of the following tokens:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>ARRIVAL</code>: find the itinerary with earliest arrival
      time
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>ENROUTE</code>: find the itinerary with the minimum total
      time enroute (in-flight plus layover time).
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>INFLIGHT</code>: find the itinerary with minimum total
      time in flight
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>LAYOVER</code>: find the itinerary with minimum total time
      spent waiting around an airport
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most people also specify an earliest departure time.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've done things right, these should be a relatively small
    changes to your code.
